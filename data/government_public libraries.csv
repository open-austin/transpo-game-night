Finally in 1992, after East Austin residents had campaigned for over a decade for a new branch in their area, a City bond issue passed appropriating funds for building six new branches in Austin, including one for Govalle. The site on Pleasant Valley Road was soon chosen and, in the spring of 1997, ground breaking ceremonies were carried out for the new branch. While it was initially to be named the Zaragoza Branch, in 1997 it was named the Cepeda Branch in honor of Eustasio Cepeda, a Latino community leader in the 1930s and 1940s. The Art in Public Places piece Dawn to Dusk by Rene Anguiano is housed at the Cepeda Branch."

Operating from its small corner station in the bank lobby, the North Oaks Branch was soon circulating over 30,000 books annually. In 1985, in dire need of more space, the lobby library was moved into two rooms on the second floor of the bank. While the new upstairs space improved matters greatly, the branch would ultimately require a larger, more permanent facility in order to meet the growing needs of Northwest Austin. For years concerned citizens and neighborhood groups like the North Oaks Neighborhood Association had lobbied for a new, full-service branch in their area. Their efforts paid off when voters approved funds for a new branch in the September 1983 bond election.
